# Image-Captioning
<ul>
  <li> Implemented Encoder-Decoder architecture for image captioning on MS COCO dataset</li>
  <li> Used SOTA Deep CNN models as Image Encoder and Decoder only Transformer architecture with Masked Attention and Cross Attention as Decoder</li>
  <li> Compared Resnet101 and Vision Transformer as feature extractor for image captioning</li>
  <li> Explored various Quantization and Distillation techniques to reduce computational complexity of trained model</li>
</ul>
